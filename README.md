#Humanoid Soccer Robot Simulation
A multithreaded humanoid robot soccer simulation featuring AI-controlled players with distinct roles, team coordination strategies, and a fault tolerance system designed for RoboCup-style competitions.

##Overview
This project implements a sophisticated robotic soccer simulation based on the Webots robotics simulator. The system includes autonomous humanoid robots that compete in teams, complete with realistic physics, visual processing, and team coordination.

##Key Features
Multithreaded AI Architecture: Separate threads for vision processing, decision making, and team communication
Role-Based Behaviors: Specialized AI for goalkeepers, defenders, midfielders, and forwards
Team Coordination: Dynamic formation, passing opportunities, and strategic positioning
Advanced Vision Systems: Ball tracking, prediction, and obstacle avoidance
Fault Tolerance: Robust fault injection system for testing resilience
Realistic Physics: Accurate simulation of robot dynamics, falls, and recovery
Performance Metrics: Real-time performance analysis and statistics

##Technical Architecture
The system consists of several key components:

Soccer Controller: Main controller for field players and goalkeepers
Referee System: Automated referee for tracking goals, time, and rule enforcement
Fault Manager: Simulates various sensor and actuator failures for robustness testing
Vision System: Image processing for ball tracking and field analysis
Motion System: Humanoid movement control including walking, kicking, and recovery
Communication Framework: Team coordination and strategy sharing

##Requirements
Webots R2023a or higher
C++ compiler with C++14 support
8GB RAM minimum (16GB recommended)

##Setup
Install Webots Simulator:

# Follow installation instructions at https://cyberbotics.com/

###Clone the Repository:
git clone https://github.com/SamiaIslam22/RoboSoccer.git
cd humanoid-soccer-sim

###Build the Project:
mkdir build && cd build
cmake ..
make

###Configure Teams:
